# Python Password Manager

I created a simple password manager in python and converted it to gui using Tkinter. The password manager ask you to login/register. To create a password  a  person has to longin. After  login  a  new window opens in which a person can generate a password by giving length and other conditions.  Used simple hashing for protecting password. The generated paswords are saved in a text file encrypted.
